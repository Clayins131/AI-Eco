# AI Eco – Environmental Impact Visualization of AI Models

## Project Overview

**AI Eco** is an interactive web-based prototype that visualizes the environmental impact of different AI models.  
The project aims to raise awareness of how AI usage is connected to energy consumption, water usage, and electronic waste, and to encourage more sustainable decision-making when using AI systems.

This project was developed as a **course assignment**, with a focus on interaction design, data visualization, and user understanding of abstract environmental concepts.

The application is implemented as a **client-side web prototype** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only.
